# twirp-example

This is an exmaple Twirp service for educational purposes. Learn more about
Twirp at its [website](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/intro.html) or
[repo](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp).

## Try it out

First, download this repo with the Go tool:
```
git clone git@github.com:ijt/twirp-example.git
cd twirp-example
```

Next, try building the client and server binaries:
```
go build ./cmd/client
go build ./cmd/server
```

And run them. In one terminal session:
```
./server
```

And in another:
```
./client
```

In the client, you should see something like this:
```
-> % ./client
size:12 color:"red" name:"baseball cap"
```

In the server, something like this:
```% ./server
received req svc="Haberdasher" method="MakeHat"
response sent svc="Haberdasher" method="MakeHat" time="109.01Âµs"
```

## Code structure

The protobuf definition for the service lives in
`rpc/haberdasher/haberdasher.proto`. The `rpc` directory name is a good way to
signal where your service definitions reside.

The generated Twirp and Go protobuf code is in the same directory. This makes it
easy to import for both internal and external users - internally, we need to
import it to have the right types for our implmentation of the service
interface, and externally it needs to be available so clients can import it.

The implementation of the server is in `internal/haberdasherserver`. Putting it
in `internal` means that it can't be imported from outside this repository,
which is nice because we don't have to think about API stability nearly as much.

In addition, `internal/hooks/logging.go` has a file which provides
[`ServerHooks`](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/hooks.html) which can log
requests. This is a good demo of how you can use hooks to extend Twirp's basic
functionality - you can use hooks to add instrumentation or even for
authentication.

Finally, `cmd/server` and `cmd/client` wrap things together into executable main
packages.
